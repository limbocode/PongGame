<b>Pong Game</b>
===

A remake of the <b>Pong Game</b> of Atari(1972) with SDL2! The game has better graphics, but yet, is not so GOOD.

This game was compiled in Linux with G++ and in Windows if MingW32, using the Qt and Code::Blocks, so you may have no problems with these IDEs.

You do <b>need</b> of:
  * <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php">SDL2</a>
  * <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/">SDL2 Image</a>
  * <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/">SDL2 TTF</a>
 

<b>Remind:</b> The res folder has to be on the *.exe folder, otherwise, it will give you a segmentation fault.

<b>Roadmap:</b> 
  * A GUI menu.
  * AI
  * Lua Script.
